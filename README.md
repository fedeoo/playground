# Playground

Do you have your own playground for studying a new framework or doing some trial? Every times you want to begin a trial, you will have to build your context.

1. support ES6
2. start a server
3. support live reload
4. support test

Also some works could be saved. For example, uglify is not necessary. CSS pre-preprocessing or post-processing is not required either.

Now, you have your own playground! Enjoy your coding time.

```sh
git clone playground
cd playground
npm install
```
